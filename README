Problem Configuration
---------------------

Each problems has a list of properties which are read from the files
  problems/config
  problems/PBNAME/config
The format of these files is whatever java.util.Properties.load says. Roughly,
it's a list of lines of the form
  KEY VALUE
The settings in problems/PBNAME/config override those in problems/config.

The following keys should be defined:
  KEY             EXAMPLE           DESCRIPTION
  name            HardOne           the problem name
  penalty         23                each bad submission adds 23 minutes of penalty
  points          10                solving this problem is worth 10 points
  memlimit        100               impose a space limit of 100 megabytes
  timelimit       10                impose a time limit of 10 seconds
  deadline        2014-02-05 16:00  hide problem after this time
  start           2014-02-01 10:00  hide problem before this time
  scoringmethod   proportional      you earn point x (fraction of solved tests)
                  binary            either you earn all points or none
  validator       builtin           compare files word by word, alowing small errors if the words could be parsed as Double
                  anything-else     run "anything-else output reference-output"; zero exit code means OK
  difficulty      4                 used to sort problems when displaying them in browser

Language Configuration
----------------------

The file languages/LANG contains the configuration for language LANG. The
format of theses files is as above. But, the keys are

  KEY         EXAMPLE         DESCRIPTION
  save        PB.java         where to save the submitted source code
  compile     javac PB.java   how to compile the code
  executable  PB.class        consider compilation successful iff this file exists
  run         java PB         how to run the executable

In all cases, PB will be substituted with the problem name (see key "name" in
Problem Configuration).


Global Configuration
--------------------

Some options aren't specific to a problem or a language. These are stored in
  config

The keys are

  KEY           EXAMPLE           DESCRIPTION
  totalpoints   100               should be the sum of all problem points (to deprecate, I think)
