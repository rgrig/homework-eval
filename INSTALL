Briefly:
1. Install the web application WAR file in a servlet server.
2. Let the web application go crazy on your system.
3. Copy homework-eval-db in /home and make files owned by the servlet server.
4. Create user `jailrun', and let servlet's server sudo as jailrun.

Step 1.
  sudo apt-get install tomcat6*
  ant war
  sudo cp HomeworkEvalApp.war /var/lib/tomcat6/webapps
At this point you should be able to see the login screen at
  http://localhost:8080/HomeworkEvalApp/

Step 2. Append the following to /etc/tomcat6/policy.d/50local.policy
  grant codeBase "file:${catalina.base}/webapps/HomeworkEvalApp/-" {
    permission java.security.AllPermision;
  }

Step 3.
  sudo cp -r homework-eval-db /home
  find /home/homework-eval-db | xargs sudo chown tomcat6

If something doesn't work, try to restart tomcat.
  sudo /etc/init.d/tomcat6 restart
