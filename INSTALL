Briefly:
1. Install the web application WAR file in a servlet server.
2. Let the web application go crazy on your system.
3. Copy homework-eval-db in /home and make files owned by the servlet server.
4. Create user `jailrun', and let servlet's server sudo as jailrun.

Step 1.
  sudo apt-get install '^tomcat7.*'
  ant war
  sudo cp HomeworkEvalApp.war /var/lib/tomcat7/webapps
At this point you should be able to see the login screen at
  http://localhost:8080/HomeworkEvalApp/
You may want to use scripts/deploys.sh to repeloy the war file later.

Step 2. Append the following to /etc/tomcat7/policy.d/50local.policy
  grant codeBase "file:${catalina.base}/webapps/HomeworkEvalApp/-" {
    permission java.security.AllPermision;
  }

Step 3.
  sudo cp -r homework-eval-db /home
  find /home/homework-eval-db | xargs sudo chown tomcat7
  sudo chmod 750 /home/homework-eval-db
You should now be able to login with pseudonym "foo" and password "bar".
The last step is required in order to hide the test data from contestants.
You may also want to run "chmod o-rx HOME" for other HOME directories that
should be inaccessible to the user created at the next step.

Step 4.
  sudo adduser jailrun # password may be weak
  sudo gcc -O3 -g limit.c -o /usr/bin/limit
  sudo visudo
In the editor, add the following lines at the end
  # Allow tomcat7 to run /usr/bin/limit while prentending to be jailrun,
  # without needing jailrun's password.
  tomcat7 ALL = (jailrun) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/limit
Now everything should work.

If something doesn't work, try to restart tomcat.
  sudo /etc/init.d/tomcat7 restart
